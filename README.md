## Geodesign-Service-Example
A example geodesign Impacts service that can be linked to Geodesign Hub. Once deployed on Heroku or similar services, it will seamlessly interoprate with Geodesign Hub. Geodesign Hub will send geometry information to the service and the service sends back impacts information to be displayed at the time of design.
